## GBF v4 & GBF Handler v6 (Java) Update

### **Overview**
GBF v4 and GBF Handler v6 are currently being developed as a complete rewrite in Java.

### **Why?**
The TypeScript version has limitations when it comes to efficiently scaling operations across multiple guilds, and handling concurrent requests becomes increasingly difficult as the bot grows. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is known for better memory management and optimized performance in long-running applications, which will allow us to handle larger volumes of data with improved speed and responsiveness.

Switching to either version of GBF Handler is completely up to you. If you have a simple bot, the TypeScript version is more than sufficient. However, if performance is a key concern, I suggest switching to the Java version. If performance remains a concern down the line, a C++ version might be considered in the distant future.

### **What's New?**
- **GBF v4**: The new Java-based version of the bot will bring enhanced stability and scalability. It is specifically designed to handle sending freebie messages to multiple servers simultaneously and fetch free games much more efficiently.

- **GBF Handler v6**: Alongside GBF v4, the handler is being completely reworked for better integration. The new version will be more modular, flexible, and optimized for performance, making maintenance more straightforward.

### **TypeScript Version**
The existing **TypeScript version** of GBF will continue to receive updates and remain functional. The Java rewrite is essentially a parallel project focused on improving performance and scalability. Both versions will coexist, with the TypeScript version still being supported while the Java version matures. 
The TypeScript version (original) will be referred to as **GBF Handler**, while the Java version will be called **GBF Java Edition** — a fun reference to Minecraft!

As of April 2025, since discord.js hasn't received any major updates recently, this will also reflect in the updates to the TypeScript version.

### **Current Status**
Development is underway, and updates are being tracked in the `#gbf-github-updates` channel. While progress is slower than anticipated, I am working hard to bring these updates to life and deliver significant improvements.

### **Note**
I am currently working on these updates solo, but I am committed to making the transition as smooth as possible. Thank you for your patience and continued support!
